            Few believed that Sony Santa Monica would be able to make Kratos
            relevant again. Times had changed, and the industry had moved on
            from the glorious, senseless aggression that helped define his
            original trilogy of games. And then God of War arrived, a title that
            straddled the line between reboot and sequel and delivered a
            definitive experience of the PS4 era in the aftermath of its action.
            It's a truly wondrous experience, capturing a sense of fluid motion
            and control in its combat that few games have ever achieved. God of
            War is a truly must-play action game, as is its thunderous sequel
            God of War Ragnarok if you can't get enough of Kratos.

            Nathan Drake couldn't have hoped for a better send-off. With a
            Thief's End, Naughty Dog embraced the legacy of PlayStation's most
            important mascot in a generation and delivered a truly seminal
            adventure. Uncharted has always felt as if it were this smooth blend
            of Tomb Raider's action and Indiana Jones' attitude, and nowhere is
            that better represented than in Uncharted 4: A Thief's End. Whether
            you're new to the series or have been following along from the
            beginning, this is cinematic action at its finest â€“ leading you from
            one heart-stopping set-piece to another with heart, humor, and an
            atmosphere of swashbuckling resilience that you can't help but fall
            in love with.

            If you thought the first game had it all, think again. Marvel's
            Spider-Man 2 sees Peter Parker teaming up with Miles Morales to
            explore whole new areas of the Big Apple in a character-swapping,
            web-shooting, bad guy-busting adventure. Deploying one of many
            newly-added abilities is simply the cherry atop the power fantasy
            cake, because I could spend hours upon hours simply traversing the
            busy Manhattan cityscape and still never get bored. Also, did we
            mention that both Venom and Kraven the Hunter make an appearance
            here? These are just a few reasons why Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is
            undoubtedly one of the best action games ever, never mind one of the
            best Marvel games to boot. If you've yet to pick up this PS5
            exclusive, here's your sign.

            If someone was browsing through the shelves of a video game store
            and came across Subnautica, they may look at the bright blue sea on
            the front cover and expect the game to be similar to the relaxing
            Endless Ocean on the Nintendo Wii. Those people would be in for a
            nasty surprise though, as although Subnautica doesn't officially
            class itself as a horror game, it would be classed by some as the
            scariest game on this list. The game taps into many common fears,
            such as the fear of the unknown, fear of darkness, fear of monsters,
            and fear of isolation, as it dumps the player into an ocean on an
            alien planet, and as one might expect, the waters are home to all
            manners of alien sea creatures. Exploration, crafting, hunting, and
            surviving are the main objectives of this open-world, or more
            specifically, open-sea title.

            In the game, the player assumes the identity of the Marked One, an
            amnesiac man trying to find and kill the mysterious Strelok within
            the Zone, a forbidden territory surrounding the Chernobyl Nuclear
            Power Plant. It is set after a fictitious second Chernobyl disaster,
            which further contaminated the surrounding area with radiation, and
            caused strange otherworldly changes in local fauna, flora, and the
            laws of physics. The background and some terminology of the game are
            borrowed from the novella Roadside Picnic and its film adaptation
            Stalker.

            Darkwood differentiates itself from the other entries on this list
            with its top-down perspective. Despite the perspective, Darkwood's
            forest is immersive, atmospheric, and horrifyingly unsettling. Set
            in the late 80s, a mysterious forest has reclaimed a large part of
            land and is continuing its steady spread, no one knowing how or why.
            Those who remain trapped in the woods are ravaged by a mysterious
            plague. Players take on the roles of various characters and their
            experiences with this strange phenomenon. Scary, supernatural, and
            full of threats, Darkwood sets itself apart as perhaps the scariest
            open-world game, with each passing minute scarier than the last.
            Players will need nerves of steel if they are to survive the
            terrifying machinations of the evil forces present in Darkwood.

            you can strap on outlaw Arthur Morganâ€™s stirrups and spend hour
            after hour journeying through the last days of the Western frontier
            in the company of your trusty horse and a few old friends. In this
            prequel to the much-loved Red Dead Redemption, weirdly named Red
            Dead Redemption 2, you find yourself playing as a member of Dutch
            van der Lindeâ€™s legendary gang, alongside a younger version of the
            original, legendary Red Dead protagonist John Marston, and are able
            to ride freely across a great American landscape. You are faced with
            either taking the path of the honourable man as the era of the Wild
            West approaches its death or spending your days being as terrible an
            outlaw can be - the choice is yours as you lasso your way through
            one adventure to the next.

            Sometimes you need a companion in your gaming whose humour is
            sardonic enough to keep you entertained. Enter Geralt the Witcher,
            who brings with him in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt one of the most
            wide-reaching and versatile adventures ever seen, as you
            inadvertently end up caught in a battle between empires for control
            and even solve a few murder mysteries involving elves and werewolves
            in the search for your adoptive daughter across a vast and
            unforgiving terrain. The many quests of Geralt of Rivia are
            plentiful and emotional enough that no gamer could want for anything
            once they pick up a controller and put on his Witcherâ€™s medallion.

            Widely regarded as one of the best RPGs of recent years, Baldur's
            Gate 3 is a winding adventure through the D&D universe. Set on the
            Sword Coast and spanning three stunning acts, the main campaign of
            BG3 is one fraught with magic, danger, and no shortage of
            mesmerising characters to meet along the way. In true tabletop
            fashion, BG3's combat is turn based - but don't let that put you
            off. Exploring is as easy as clicking on items, spots on the ground,
            or NPCs to converse with, and with fully-motion captured dialogue
            animations, there's something universally yet uniquely charming
            about Baldur's Gate 3.
