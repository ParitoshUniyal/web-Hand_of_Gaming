          Games have always existed in a numbers-obsessed industry. Sega vs.
          Nintendo defined a generation in the '90s, while today's comparatively
          mild console wars and monthly Circana reports keep sales figures near
          the forefront of games-related discussion. New monetization models
          require new metrics for success — monthly active users, player
          retention rates, in-game revenue, etc. — but one of the industry's
          biggest questions remains: What are the best-selling video games of
          all time?

            such a massive sales success. Krafton creative director Dave Curd
            told The Verge it has sold 75 million copies of PUBG as of December
            2021. That will likely be the shooter’s final sales tally, as it
            went free to play a month later in January 2022. <br />

            While free mobile downloads don't count toward its sales total, it's
            worth noting PUBG Mobile had been downloaded over 1 billion times as
            of March 2021.

            Arguably the most timeless video game ever created, Tetris sits
            comfortably atop the list of all-time bestsellers with 520 million
            copies sold, according to The Tetris Company. That number includes
            sales across all available platforms, with the majority coming from
            mobile (425 million paid mobile downloads as of 2014, according to
            Henk Rogers, The Tetris Company's managing director). <br />

            Tetris was initially released for the Soviet Union-developed
            Elektronika 60 computer, and variations of the classic puzzler have
            since been made for over 50 different platforms. Notably, it helped
            launch the Game Boy to success, eventually selling 35 million copies
            on Nintendo's handheld console. <br />

            Modern variations of the classic are still being released: Tetris
            Effect: Connected brought the puzzler to current-gen consoles with
            an emotional twist, while most recently, in 2020, SEGA released Puyo
            Puyo Tetris 2.
